# About me

Welcome to the my GitHub repository, I'm Dmytro Kovryzhenko and I'm a coding geek.

My stack is a **C++** and **Python** mostly, _Java_ and _C#_ - sometimes.
I work with **SQLite** database for storing data.

Can deploy for platforms: **Windows** and **Linux**.

Version control system - **Git**, preferable.

Have knowledge in **OOP**, **Algorithms**, **Data Structures**, C++\\**STL**.

**C++** frameworks and libraries: **Qt**, **SFML**, **SDL**, **Boost**, **FMT**, **Aspose**.

**Python** frameworks and libraries: **PyGame**, **Tkinter** (_ttkbootstrap_).

Build my **C++** projects via **CMake** (in a very rare occasions via _Makefile_),
but also via _**Visual Studio**_ non-cmake solution (where Windows version is enough).
